# Neural Networks for Financial Time Series Forecasting

This repository contains the Python code used to forecast:

(i) the closing prices of eight stock market indices; and  
(ii) the closing prices of six USD-related currency exchange rates, using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models and their variants:  
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).
