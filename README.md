# Neural-Networks-for-Financial-Time-Series-Forecasting-
This repository contains the python code used to to forecast: (i) the closing price of eight stock market indexes; and (ii) the closing price of six currency exchange rates related to the USD, using the RNNs model and its variants: the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).
